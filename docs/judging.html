            <div class="half">
                <h2>About Lorcán</h2>
                <p>After making his debut in 2020 with a series of home recorded singles, Lorcán is making an impact on
                    the Bristol music scene. His music traverses the space between dream pop, ambient and indie rock.
                    His songs are worlds of contrasts, with mellow baritone vocals against crunching drum machines and
                    crisp ethereal synths twinkling over jangling vibrato guitar. Lorcán’s music captures the transience
                    of lived experience, celebrating both the mundane and the dreamlike aspects of life.</p>

        <h2>How Lorcán would use the grant</h2>
        <p>I am Lorcán, a Bristol born and Bristol based ambient-dreampop artist. Since 2020 I have been self-releasing
            music and making an impact in the Bristol and wider UK music scene. My music incorporates influences and
            feelings from ambient music to shoegaze and even post punk. I believe deeply in the DIY ethos and put this
            into action, creating music videos, artworks and collaborating with artists in different fields in the
            Bristol scene. I always want our live shows to be a sonic journey, filled with highs and lows and
            experimentation all the way through.

            This prize would help my music career no end. As a musician from a low economic background I sometimes feel
            like I am fighting so hard to keep things moving in our current times, I always manage to keep the
            motivation and the drive but it can be hard sometimes when also working a day job and caring for my 4 year
            old daughter. This fund would offer me an opportunity to funnel money into places that it can make the most
            difference. I would buy new gear where needed, like a new synthesiser. But I would also invest it into
            things like merch, promotions, radio plugging campaigns and hours to record my debut LP. It would be an
            amazing step up to allow me and my band to flourish and have some funds to push ourselves forward.

            As a user of Factory Studios, the benefit of the rehearsal time would be amazing. I am currently training up
            a new synth player for my band and working on the live set for future gigs. This would give us an amazing
            opportunity to focus on rehearsing and put the money saved into other important places.

            Overall this prize would be potential live changing if not definitely career changing. I don't know if there
            has ever been a time in my life where I have had a thousand or more pounds to just put into my music and my
            career growth.</p>

                    psych-anarcho art-punks Bristol-based duo who have never been afraid to wear their influences on
                    their musical sleeves. Psychedelic, garage rock, punk blues ... They perform "docufictional" songs

        <h2>How AlterModerns would use the grant</h2>
        <p>AlterModerns is an art project, bigger than just music. We are two artists, more than just two musicians. Our
            band`s project is congregating the multiplicity of the artistic expressions on its full, uniting music with
            visual arts, fashion and social empowerment. We aim to connect with more creative local people, sharing with
            them the opportunity to create together, using their professional knowledge and skills, moving our band to a
            next level. Working with a group of artists will enable us to develop our identity on all facets. We wish to
            transform our live performances into a big show, including art projections and unique fashion designs which
            translate our music/lyrics vibe.
            We have been writing new songs for our second album and we wish to record it in the first semester of 2023.
            Our desire is making the artwork and hand printing it all at our art studio in Bedminster, DIATRIBE
            Printmakers. A bit of unicity and craft job while the World goes so much into the digital aspects.
            We are self-employed artists, immigrants from another continent, surviving thanks to the Universal Credit
            benefit since the lockdown, doing our best and all efforts to live from our art. Having a woman on the
            drums, while sharing the vocals and singing about equality is something we are proud of, and we wish to be
            able to play more gigs around the UK and EU, empowering more female artists to join the art and music scene.
            The Future Sound of Bristol prize will allow us to make it all happen: contracting creative professionals
            for making our new songs videos, band pictures, communication channels, editing the art projections for live
            performances and building sustainable fashion designs with our music identity; practicing our new songs at a
            professional environment; recording and pressing our second album; purchasing materials for producing the
            artworks and the merchandising products.
            We want to do more art for more people. AlterModerns is a kind of manifesto itself.</p>

        <div class="flex_section">
            <div class="half">
                <h2>About High Climbers</h2>
                <p>High Climbers was born in 2012 by Bristol newcomers Karim Bouthera (France) and Mike Robertson
                    (Australia). What began as a way to communicate soon grew into a strong friendship and obsession,
                    and the boys enjoyed playing their eclectic brand of lofi psych-folk as a duo for several years
                    until power couple Rob Burgess and Susanna Bar came into the fold on rhythm. Now, over ten years
                    later, High Climbers is a five-piece, joined recently by film maker and lecturer Richard Edkins, who
                    has ignited a new chapter in the band after their return from a three-year hiatus. Their sound is a
                    melting pot of inspiration from their travels, from noise pop and psychedelia to funk and French
                    hip-hop. Described as both ‘gorgeous’ and ‘wild’, High Climbers deliver immersive live performances
                    and are still committed to bridging the cultural divide.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>How High Climbers would use the grant</h2>
        <p>High Climbers has been going for over 10 years and is as much an embodiment of creative passion as it is
            about friendship. Since its inception, the band has evolved from a two-piece to a five-piece, from an
            alt-folk duo to a psych-funk-rap quintet. At the centre of the band are five best friends, whose strong bond
            is undoubtedly the reason this project has stood the test of time despite much growth in popularity. High
            Climbers is the glue that holds us all together, with rehearsals, gigs and studio time giving us a reason to
            continue being in each other's lives - and, as we all get older (HC members span from 32 to 50), and
            children are born (there are 5 in total, and that's without counting the band members), creating music
            together has never been so vital to our wellbeing. By continuing to do what we love, we all become better
            people and parents in the process.

            Having just returned from a three-year hiatus (pandemics, key members moving abroad, etc.), the drive to
            keep this project going has never felt stronger. I (Mike) am the one who left, and since coming back I can
            feel the others' urge to play and evolve is more prominent than ever. I guess this confirms just how much
            this project means to us. But, as with all endeavours in life, passion isn't always enough. One needs to
            strike a balance between talent, persistence, connections, good fortune and timing. While we consider
            ourselves extremely fortunate to have all found each other, we've never been so good at shouting about it,
            and we certainly have never been good at selling ourselves. And, over time, we've realised this is as much
            of a blessing as it is a curse.

            We would therefore use the Future Sound of Bristol prize to fund the following:
            - Studio recording time (we've written four new tracks in four months and see no sign of slowing down)
            - Music video production for a couple of singles (Rich, our bassist, is a filmmaker and lecturer and made an
            amazing video for us in the past, and the man would need adequate compensation for anything made going
            forward)
            - A 10-day tour around northern France and Belgium where we already have connections
            - Childminding while we're at the studio (This is a big one. Rob and Susie are married and have a
            one-year-old, which means she needs to be looked after while we're playing. We've gotten around this so far
            by rehearsing either down the road at Room4Studios with Nana stepping in as Susie runs down the road just in
            time to play, or at home in their lounge room after 8:30pm with the electronic drum kit and baby monitor in
            view)
            - Single launch at Elmers. We'd love to put on a single launch show at one of our favourite local pubs in
            Old Market and would need a bit of money to promote it, pay the other bands, and hire backline
            - Vinyl pressing for a 4-track 12 inch release
            - Social media marketing budget

            So, now you know a little bit more about us. At the centre of it all is really just five best friends who
            need music to survive, and while we'll continue to play until we're withered and grey, this funding would
            give us that extra boost we need to take our project and passion to the next level. And, after 10 years, we
            could seriously use that.

            Thank you for reading.

            Musical regards,
            Mike, Karim, Susie, Rob, and Rich.</p>

        <h2>How Valentino Farias would use the grant</h2>
        <p>My project is focused on creating a unique blend of electronic, orchestral, and indie sounds that incorporate
            classic elements. As an artist, I am constantly seeking opportunities to develop my skills and enhance my
            music. I experiment with new instruments, listen to new music, and constantly learn new writing and
            production techniques.

            Winning the Future Sound of Bristol 1st Prize would be a significant boost to my project. The £5k prize
            money would enable me to invest in high-quality equipment, software, and marketing to enhance my production
            capabilities. Additionally, the 1-month membership at Factory Studios would provide me with access to a
            professional recording environment where I could refine my sound and collaborate with other musicians.

            With these resources, I would be able to take my music to the next level and create something truly special.
            The exposure that comes with winning the Future Sound of Bristol contest would also be invaluable, as it
            would allow me to reach a wider audience and connect with industry professionals.

        <h2>How Russelio would use the grant</h2>
        <p>I used to be in a band and one time we supported Joanna Newsom, but that was a long time ago. I was in the
            doldrums creatively but after having children I began to feel that I needed to express myself musically
            again, to show them (and myself I guess) who I really am. It was a now or ever moment.

            Anyway, I decided to start a solo project, which I work on when I’m not being a partner, parent, friend or
            employee, and I write, perform and (so far) record and produce everything myself. I describe it as lo-fi
            chamber pop: it’s all based around solid melodies and lush harmonies, it’s mainly acoustic instruments but
            with drum samples and touches of synth.

            I write about things that I find beautiful. My song Joan Didion is a valedictory song about the great writer
            and cultural icon that was inspired by Simon and Garfunkel’s song Frank Lloyd Wright. My three-year-old son
            (also called Frank) was really taken by that song and it got me thinking that saying farewell to a really
            well known iconic figure (but, crucially, not a musician) is quite a powerful thing to do in song.

            Getting Ready was something silly I made up to get my daughter to brush her teeth. On the face of it it’s
            about getting ready for the day, the ritual of the morning routine, but it’s also about getting ready for
            life, for adulthood – ’the world outside’.

            Russelio was a nickname from when I lived in Spain.

            A Future Sound of Bristol prize would be a real game-changing development that could transform my music
            practice and help me realise whatever potential I have. I would use the prize to record professionally in a
            studio as well as continue to develop my skills as a producer with some more professional equipment (as well
            as a new laptop, as mine is on its last legs). A prize would also help me to develop a set-up to play live,
            which is an important next step as I try to develop an audience for my music.</p>

                <h2>About Kaya Street</h2>
                <p>"Kaya" meaning "pure, home, resting place, the healer".

                    Kaya Street is the creation of singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Bristol based producer
                    Kaya.

                    Dark, uplifting and atmospheric, the Kaya Street sound blends between dub reggae, afrobeat, trip hop
                    and desrt blues and deals with socially conscious themes in a time of rising nationalism and
                    environmental crisis.

                    Press Release for Dark|Light 2020

                    Bristol-based rebel producer Kaya Street is taking his atmospheric blend of dub reggae/world fusion
                    to create his debut EP Dark|Light 2020.

                    A dark, bass driven ride through the apocalyptic events of 2020, Dark|Light 2020 is a sharp account
                    of current global affairs and a passionate rebuke to rising global nationalism and regressive
                    forces.

                    Made remotely during lockdown, Dark|Light 2020 features musicians and singers from across the world:
                    Nigeria, Argentina, America, Germany, Canada, Cuba, Jamaica, Spain, France, Poland and the UK. The
                    songs deal with themes of political protests, climate change, surveillance capitalism, state
                    terrorism, culture wars, toxic vanity, media manipulation, progressive internationalism and pandemic
                    exposed worldwide inequalities. After a chance online meeting the album was Mixed and Mastered by
                    legendary Canadian reggae producer, DUBMATIX, and features prolific French Horn section Booom Hornz,
                    featuring Tribuman, and vocals from rising Nigerian star Churemi .

                    Soaking up real world events from the confines of a disorientating new lockdown existence in the UK,
                    the EP’s creation was an artistic act of global solidarity in the new world, pandemic era. Through
                    focusing the subject matter to world events and establishing personal connections with musicians in
                    other countries, the creative process looked to mirror the passionate advocacy for internationalism
                    and inter-communalism embedded within the songs.

                    The EP consists of three tracks. “Fire in the Street”, comments on the global unrest and worldwide
                    outrage that came to define people power in 2020. “Lockdown”, shouts out to the sinister practices
                    of political data mining in the digital era. It spins the lockdown concept on its head by asking if
                    we are ever really “free”? “Rise Up”, provides a rallying call to those who feel lost and
                    disheartened by the global emergencies of our time. Each one is packed with baseline punch and
                    politically charged lyrics for a soundtrack adventure into Dark|Light 2020.

                    Beginning as a 10 piece brass band, the constantly evolving Kaya Street project has had many
                    accomplishments headling numerous festivals around the South West, UK. Highlights include 2018's St
                    Paul's 50th Carnival, Boardmasters, Kaya Festival, One Love, and supporting artist such as The
                    Specials, The Abyssinians, and Julian Marley.

        <h2>How Kaya Street would use the grant</h2>
        <p>After a life time of making music and over 10 years as a project with may different line ups, the Future
            Sound of Bristol prize would give a much needed opportunity to capitalise on a current live project momentum
            for the band after gaining national exposure through BBC 6 Radio (Don Letts) and BBC Introducing South West
            (Sarah Gosling). Taking the bedroom produced tracks out to a live audience. It would also be an amazing
            chance to invest in music which has a targeted socially conscious and internationalist appeal seeking to
            raise the profile of topical issues, as can be seen in the powerful Stories of the 21st Century
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMfnQ3JqJw . It would give a massive boost to the ability to prepare for
            festival circuit appearances and create opportunities for cross collaboration with Bristol based venues
            nurturing a serious, committed, professional and artistic band active in the local scene. Simply put it
            would allow a long held dream to be realised - getting an epic live show together!!</p>

        <h2>How Saloon Dion would use the grant</h2>
        <p>Formed in Bristol in early 2021, Saloon Dion have become renowned for their cathartic performances, and
            groove-laden, gritty songwriting.

            Starting out in some of Bristol’s most iconic venues, the band soon began touring the UK and Europe,
            performing with the likes of FEET, Katy J Pearson, Opus Kink, Pip Blom, and more.

            Within a year, they had signed to tastemaker labels, Permanent Creeps, and Nice Swan records, and released a
            string of singles to critical acclaim. The band have since gone on to part ties with Nice Swan, in favor of
            self-releasing the debut EP, ‘Muckers’, out May 2023.

            Their most recent single, ‘I Don’t Feel’ has received notable airtime and support from Chris Hawkins, Marc
            Riley, and Tom Robinson – who recently handpicked Saloon Dion to headline as part of his NExSW Generator
            showcase.

            With three more singles to be released and a trip to Texas for this year’s SXSW, Saloon Dion are working
            tirelessly to elevate their music and touring to new heights by the end of 2023.

            And while this has been a fantastic and promising start to our career, we’re in danger of being forced to
            resign before we’ve even got going.

            As it stands, we have no financial backing, no record deal, and no distributor deal.

            The band is entirely self-funded. We pay for everything out of our fees, merch, and increasingly, our own
            pockets. We all work full-time day jobs alongside our music careers and have been trying to put in money
            where we can, but with the cost of living rising, it’s becoming difficult to keep ourselves afloat.

            A huge goal for us this year is to release more music. We believe that the support we’re receiving from
            press, radio, DSPs, and showcase initiatives needs to be aligned with a consistent, and professional release
            plan.

            Financial support from Future Sound of Bristol would allow us to record, release, and market our next EP
            (for which all the songs have already been written).

            This would provide us with the opportunity and financial means to continue pursuing our passions, and
            hopefully take the next big step in our career – being signed to an independent or major label.

            Ultimately, our biggest fear is that our financial situation will be the deciding barrier between us and a
            successful career in music.</p>

        <h2>How B of Briz would use the grant</h2>
        <p>About your project:
            My project is a concept album – working title ‘Patriarchy, a gentle reminder; Volume 1: Toxic Masculinity’
            and it’s a feminist collection of songs about the harm that Patriarchy causes to women and men, and the ways
            that it, as a system and set of beliefs, can twist masculinity into something that’s toxic. It’s sometimes
            angry and confrontational, but also full of humanity and empathy.

            Progress made so far: I have 10 songs which are about to go into a final phase of rewrites/ production
            Working titles (& descriptions):
            Master Debater (aka ‘the kinda convos I’ve had with certain kinda guys when they find out I’m a feminist/
            got a PhD/ etc etc’)
            Car crash boy (aka ‘it’s great you’ve had an epiphany, but don’t be a d*ck about it!)
            Let yourself Cry (aka ‘it sucks the Patriarchy doesn’t want you to have access to the full range of human
            emotions, but we want you to know you can’)
            Effboy (aka ‘is he just a player or is it something more twisted, and also, is being ‘a player’ actually
            kinda twisted too?’)
            Nice guy (aka ‘respectability politics are a wash, at best’)
            Hates you too (aka ‘Patriarchy sucks for everyone!’)
            Bad Date (aka ‘What the dysfunctional public intellectual you’re following says about you -and why it’s a
            red flag’)
            A Very 21st Century Family Annihilator (aka ‘We have to think about worst case scenarios’)
            Incel (aka ‘misogyny + feelings of inadequacy = the ripple effect of harm’)
            You do you (aka ‘Just let us live our lives, bro, and you can live yours’)

            How I would use the Future Sound of Bristol grant & prize:
            Rehearsal time: I would use rehearsal time at Factory Studios to refine, develop and practice my vocal
            before recording.

            1K plan:
            Production costs –to include: commissions from other artists for production elements (to include mastering),
            plus some time in the recording studio to record vocals.
            (I would then plan to cover legal costs and distribution costs out of pocket, and continue DIY radio
            plugging).

            2k plan:
            Production costs –as above in 1k plan
            Legal costs –some limited advice from a lawyer who specialises in music and music production.
            Distribution costs – via CD Baby
            (I would then plan to continue DIY radio plugging).

            5k plan:
            Production costs –as above in 1k plan, as well as a visual artist for cover art, and additional mixing.
            Legal costs –some limited advice from a lawyer who specialises in music and music production.
            Distribution costs – via CD Baby
            Release/promo – Although I will work on PR and a social media strategy for the release, I would like to work
            with a radio plugger. I’ve built some foundations in terms of radio play (through many new music enthusiasts
            on local and online radio shows, and also on BBC Radio 6 Music) but feel that this is an area a professional
            could add some value.</p>

        <h2>How Mary in the Mirror would use the grant</h2>
        <p>I launched this project in 2021 and am getting ready to release my 6th solo single next month. My music has
            been played on radio stations across the globe in places like Nashville,, New York, Oregon, Canada, New
            Zealand, Brazil, Croatia, Germany, France, Poland & across the UK, including Bristol’s Ujima radio - my last
            single was featured as one of their “Power Plays” in January. My music videos have had tens of thousands of
            streams. My most successful single got over 25k streams on Spotify. I recently won arts council funding to
            develop my creative practice, so I’ve been hard at work in the studio writing new material, and have at
            least 2 albums worth of material to promote. In order to effectively promote the music I now need more
            funding, so that I can take the project out to the people and do a tour to raise my profile. I currently do
            almost everything from home, I’ve built the project from scratch in my living room, and most of my work is
            currently done at from home here in Bristol, where I do my recording, song writing and marketing. It’s been
            a lot of work, and I’m funding a lot of the activities myself. I have to pay for the mixing and mastering of
            my music at present, though I’m learning how to do that side of things for myself as I’ve been working with
            Grammy award winning producers and song writers, to hone my craft. Mike Mangini who produced Joss Stones
            first album as well as numerous other known artists, is one of my mentors, I’ve also been mentored by KRUST,
            and I’m working with a bunch of industry professionals who are helping me to continuously improve and gain
            traction on my music. I have been a little quiet recently due to focusing on my arts council project, but my
            next single is due to be released on the 19th April and I’ll be doing a livestream and then a gig at the
            Plough Inn to promote the single. The next step for me is to plan a tour, so winning more funding will be
            really important for this step, as I’ll need to invest in rehearsal space, appropriate transport, paying
            musicians and create a marketing campaign which I’ll need a budget for. I can’t wait to get past the start
            up phase of my music career plan! As with most start ups it takes at least 2 years for things to really get
            moving, but having studied really hard for this I’m confident that success is on its way and I’m really
            excited about the future! Thanks for taking the time to read my application and I hope you enjoy the music.

                    launch for 'Lets Talk About the Weather' (delayed from 2020 due to Covid) exploring our connection
                    to ourselves, nature and each other in a time of climate crisis- inside an immersive indoor forest
                    in Bristol. The show was featured in the Metro, the attendees planted 200 trees with One Tree Per
                    Child in Bristol and £300 of the show’s profits were donated to the charity. Festivals included
                    Green Man, Blue Dot, Standon Calling and Boomtown.



                    In 2022, Emily released an EP of experimental electronica instrumentals with label Silent Kid,
                    features included Dummy Magazine, Earmilk and BBC Introducing. Releases lined up for Spring 2023

        <h2>How Emily Magpie would use the grant</h2>
        <p>I have a 3 track EP set for release this Spring with Def Pressé and received funding to produce and mix 4
            further tracks from Help Musicians. I've completed these tracks and am now producing a further 6 to be
            released with Def Pressé as an album.

            After a fairly quiet few years in terms of releases this is a real milestone time in my career where I have
            industry support to expand my fan base. We are planning to release the album over the summer 2023, alongside
            festivals, gigs, and an album launch gig.

            £1000 would enable me to work full time on completing production and mixing the album in May to a high
            quality. This would enable us to build on the momentum from the EP release and begin releasing singles over
            the summer (PR funded by the label).

            £2000 would enable me to work full time on mixing the album plus invest in merchandise for the release and
            cover some travel expenses for gigs. The label will be funding vinyl for the release and I would like to
            create t-shirts and some special merchandise related to the album's themes to accompany this.

            £5000 would enable me to work full time on mixing the album, invest in merchandise, cover travel expenses
            for more shows around the UK and create an immersive launch event in Bristol.
            For my previous album we held a sold out launch at Loco Klub which we transformed into an indoor forest with
            projections and foraged foliage. We also planted 200 trees with One Tree Per Child and donated £300 from
            ticket sales to them. We were featured in the Metro and Bristol 24/7. I ran a successful Kickstarter to do
            this with a similar budget.
            For this album the themes are around mental health, vulnerability and communication and I would create an
            immersive experience at a Bristol venue for late summer / early Autumn when the album is released. We would
            create elements of this to be transportable and play several other headline shows around the UK with these.
            For the previous album launch we also played a sold out headline show at The Sebright Arms in London.

            The rehearsal time at Factory would enable my band and I to rehearse the new live show to a high standard
            for the release.</p>

                <h2>About Florence & The Bare Souls</h2>
                <p>From sleazy blues, to sultry soul, to good old fashioned rock n' roll, Florence & The Bare Souls are
                    breathing fresh life into classic genres.

                    Florence leads the group with a rich and powerful voice, reminiscent of the 70's soul greats, and
                    writes lyrical, soul-baring and often painfully relatable songs, exploring passion, fear and joy.
                    She is joined by some of the finest musical talent her hometown of Bristol has to offer. The full
                    7-piece outfit brings the songs to life on stage with an energetic and passionate performance. A
                    live show not to be missed.

                    Since forming in 2016, Florence & The Bare Souls have rocked many of the southwest's best live music
                    venues, as well as a number of festivals including Shindig, Wilderness and Boomtown.

                    "Imagine if Etta James started a band with Led Zeppelin and brought some funk playing friends with
                    her, and you'll get Florence & The Bare Souls.

                    Some of Bristol's finest musicians bringing an old sound right up to date, in a way that'll have you
                    up and yelling for more. True class.”

                    Kanan Keenay - Grammy-Nominated Song Writer

                    "We defy anyone, of any musical genre bias, to watch lead vocalist Florence Pardoe channeling Etta
                    James and not come away gobsmacked that they’ve not come across this band before.

                    If you love and appreciate live music, regardless of your preferred genre, Florence & The Bare Souls
                    are a MUST SEE LIVE part of the Bristol music scene."

        <p>This year we are hoping to record new material that really represents where we are as a band today. We have
            really honed our sound and bonded as a band. We are at the top of our game and have written the best music
            we've ever created. We are so excited to share this with the world, however we aren't in a financial
            position to do so without help. We have applied for funding, about which we are yet to hear if we have been
            successful, but even this funding will only get us so far. This prize would mean the world to us as it would
            allow us to share our music with a wider audience and ultimately book more shows and bring more joy to
            people through our live shows and recorded music. This is what we live for and why we do what we do. We know
            that now is our time. The quality of our music and our live show is there, all we need is some help to bring
            it to the world!</p>

                    ESOP's music is populated by grotesque imagery and vivid symbolism, drawing from artists across

        <p>Our project is essentially called ESOP Phase II, as we are looking to level up and lean into the theatrical
            side of our live performances for the next album, while continuing to cultivate inclusive spaces at our
            shows for everyone to enjoy and feel safe in. Following a self-funded tour in March 2023 to promote our
            debut EP, we are planning an album release to coincide with a brand new show including stage wear and stage
            design (lights and smoke machines). The album (which we're currently sitting on and looking for ways to
            fund) and initial big Bristol show (planned for November) will be followed by another UK tour in early 2024.
            The funding would be used to print the LP, pay for artwork, outfits, photos, stage props/design, PR and

                <h2>About Fabio Ferri</h2>
                <p>Fabio Ferri is a musician and composer based in Bristol, active in a number of projects at the heart
                    of the jazz and experimental music scene. His solo project includes recording albums with ambitious
                    concepts and production techniques, and performances with solo electric guitar or ensembles. On 8th
                    December Griboyedov Incident, an album that takes inspiration from late romantic and contemporary
                    classical music, was released and distributed by himself and the label Camembert Électrique, and saw
                    a release party (now available on YouTube) on 17th January at the Gallimaufry, one of the most
                    popular as well as adventurous venues in Bristol. The main aspects of his playing and compositional
                    technique are uniqueness, ultimate creativity and deep knowledge of a wide range of genres. In his
                    shows he already performed at some of the best known venues in Bristol and the South West, art
                    fairs, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He and his music will feature in the Netflix show "Baby
                    Reindeer". Keen explorer of the yet unknown and of the interaction of music with other forms of art,
                    in particular on the visual side.
                    Other projects he is currently part of include the jazz band Deems Experiment, the live band of the
                    rapper Danny Burrito, the folk band Trikkeballakke.

                    "Based in the South West and originally from Italy, Fabio Ferri is rapidly garnering a name for his
                    avant-garde, experimental compositions and live performances. Fabio really invites you into his
                    strange world of music through his playful interaction and a combination of not taking himself too
                    seriously, whilst simultaneously showcasing exceptional virtuosity that fully justifies the whole
                    occasion, making his performances a strangely unifying event in avant-garde music. Technically
                    focussing his prophetic proficiency with the electric guitar, his inventive use of looping
                    technology and his inherent understanding for structure and time...Fabio's live shows are more of a
                    journey than a destination, make sure you're along for the ride...as a man on the cross, he has no
                    fear" @phatbristol

                    Tap bow use and mildly blasphemous incorporation of 'prepared' crucifix pendant whilst the camp
                    occultism of Kenneth Anger played in the background. A stylophone was also produced and there was a
                    merry parade of followers which capered out into the bar beyond to perplex the gathered Specials
                    fans outside" Jez Winship about the performance at Music is Murder

        <h2>How Fabio Ferri would use the grant</h2>
        <p>I'm an emerging part-time musician (and currently pure mathematics researcher) and I'm committed to make
            music my main occupation. I identify as an independent musician and composer. I recently put together a
            stable live band for my project, which will see the very first performances in the next few months. I would
            invest the prize into my third release with these new people I'm working with, and put together live shows
            that will break the barriers between music and visual art as well as between the stage and the crowd. This
            partially happened in my release party at the Gallimaufry (which you can watch on Youtube via my linked
            channel), where live painting, free musical improvisations over expressionist paintings, multiple outfits
            and a final collective jam together with the audience took place and made it a unique experience (for us,
            the audience, the venue...). I would like to create more shows within this concept by focusing even more on
            the theatrical, interactive and multimedia aspect of my vision, with a full high energy band and
            visual/theatre collaborators (which may include the famous artist Ergo Phizmiz), and incorporating these
            ideas into the recording as well, which will be paired with a video. The actual musical genre will be a
            coherent blend between jazz and heavy sounds, passing through important influences from classical music
            (indeed, my second album Griboyedov Incident is a concept album about late romantic and contemporary
            classical composers), free jazz and experimental music.

            A boost from such a forward thinking institution such as yours would be both fundamental and highly
            beneficial for this purpose. I've always operated with my own forces and funding and definitely got further
            than I would have thought, but the industry is often shadowing those who have no external help and are
            outside the mainstream. As soon as I read "Future Sound of Bristol" I thought this was for me, as I'm
            respected instrumentalist and artist in the musical community of Bristol and definitely incorporate those
            uniqueness, genre-crossing, creativity and long term vision that identifies what I do with "future sound".
            I'm happy and excited to apply for this and thank you for your consideration.</p>

        <h2>How Dwell would use the grant</h2>
        <p>The extent to which this prize would help cannot be overstated enough. Recently, the band has started to gain
            a lot of momentum, we have been playing some sold out shows at larger venues than we are used to and
            released a one off single on Fire Talk Record's "Open Tab" platform. But, we have been struggling to
            capitalise on this as much as we perhaps could due to financial constraints. For example, we are wanting to
            record a large body of work soon (such as an EP or an album) and whilst the songs are all written and ready
            to go, we are having to wait until we have raised enough money to be able to afford it. In an age where
            social media is king and peoples attention spans are therefore notoriously short, we are anxious not to
            loose peoples hard earned attention and excitement around our music.

            We are also firm believers in the power of playing live to reach new audiences. Therefore, some of the prize
            money would also go towards helping to finance a tour over July this year, which we have already started
            booking. This tour will be to support the release of two singles we have coming out later this year. We
            have, for example, been invited to do a show in Dublin as a part of this tour, which we have been unable to
            commit to because it may not be able to afford to make the journey. If we were to win the prize money this
            could become a possibility again.

            As a band, we do everything ourselves. We do not have a booking agent or management and whilst we are
            extremely motivated to do all the work ourselves, it can't be denied this is hard work, especially when done
            in free time in-between full time work elsewhere. If we were to be lucky enough to win some of the prize
            money and rehearsal time at factory studios, we really feel it could help us to take a significant amount of
            steps up the ladder towards the band becoming successful and self sustaining, reaching ever wider an
            audience and fulfilling more creative ambitions and goals.</p>

                <h2>About Make Friends</h2>
                <p>Make Friends began in 2017, formed by a group of friends inspired by the indie-dance-punk of early
                    era Foals' 'Antidotes', and the melodic alt-pop of Bombay Bicycle Club, which the band then fused to
                    form their fresh take on modern indie music. Their debut EP forged fan favourite 'Ellie', followed
                    by a string of singles and a second EP in 2021. Much of their work was written over various states
                    of lockdown, which supplied a surprisingly creative climate for the band, with lyrics naturally
                    gravitating towards tackling themes of isolation and mental health.
                    To date, the band have seen strong support from BBC Introducing in the West, with single 'Fever'
                    even receiving Radio 1 Airplay, as well as being selected for a live session at the esteemed Maida

        <p>With the help of Ed Nash (Bombay Bicycle Club) at the helm as producer, Make Friends' debut album "Why Is
            There Always Something?" was written and recorded over the entirety of 2022, and has been created at £0
            debt. We're incredibly proud of the albums material, and we hope to get it into as many ears as possible.

            The band make a modest monthly income on streaming (very loyal numbers on DSPs) and good fees on live, but
            are looking for any additional funds to assist with the costs of mastering, manufacturing and most

            the band can start to really grow their fanbase.</p>

        <div class="flex_section">
            <div class="half">
                <h2>About Ålesund</h2>
                <p>Introducing Ålesund, the alt pop band hailing from Bristol UK, fronted by the ethereal vocals of
                    British-Norwegian singer-songwriter Alba Torriset. Drawing inspiration from a diverse range of
                    musical genres and artists, Ålesund's sound is a fusion of dreamy pop hooks, atmospheric
                    soundscapes, and alternative rock riffs, which have drawn comparisons to the likes of Kate Bush,
                    Florence and the Machine and London Grammar.


                    Growing up in Hastings, England, Alba's love for singing was nurtured by the acoustics of the local
                    churches she attended, where she would often perform. She later attended a specialist music college
                    in Lewes, where she was trained classically. But after graduating, Alba decided to forge her own
                    musical path and started writing her own music.


                    Since then, Ålesund has been making waves in the UK music scene, earning praise from industry
                    tastemakers like BBC Radio Bristol, BBC Introducing in the West, Amazing Radio, and RTE Ireland.
                    Their live performances have been described as captivating and mesmerizing.


                    The band's notable achievements include playing at some of the UK's biggest festivals, including
                    Glastonbury, Bestival, Boomtown, and Cambridge Folk Festival, as well as touring the country and
                    playing in major cities like London, Cardiff and Manchester.


                    In addition to their successful performances, Ålesund has collaborated with renowned producer Jake
                    Bright (Mary Spender, Kate Stapely) and EDM producer and DJ Jimi Needles on a remix of their single
                    "Lightning." They are also preparing for a co-headline tour in May 2023 with Manchester-based artist
                    Megan Dixon-Hood.


                    For Alba, the creative process is deeply personal, with her own experiences and feelings serving as
                    the inspiration for her songs. She aims to create an atmosphere with her music that evokes genuine
                    emotion and connection, from carefree abandon to thought-provoking reflection. Her passion for all
                    aspects of the creative process extends to the visuals that accompany the music, ensuring a cohesive
                    and immersive experience for the listener.


                    Looking ahead, Ålesund's goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of their music, playing to
                    larger audiences, and connecting with fans around the world. As Alba believes, music is a great
                    unifier, and Ålesund's unique sound is sure to resonate with listeners everywhere.</p>

        <h2>How Ålesund would use the grant</h2>
        <p>We are imminently about to release new music in April and May 2023. They will be the first two single from
            our new 5 track EP. We are then going on a 9 date tour of the UK in May, which will lead us nicely into
            playing a host of festivals over summer. We will then continue to release the rest of our EP throughout
            autumn with an another tour starting to be booked up for October/November.
            We are totally self funded, self managed, self booked etc. So any financial help we receive we'd be BEYOND
            grateful for. Everything the band makes from gigs goes straight back into the band kitty to help us pay for
            rehearsals, contribute towards fuel, pay for new merch etc. If we were lucky enough to receive one of the
            prizes you would happy to know the free rehearsal space would be put to great use as we prepare to get our
            live set perfect for tour, festival season and then Autumn tour. 2023 is looking to be a great year for us,
            we'd be so chuffed and honoured to have Future Sounds support as we embark on this exciting new chapter for
            Ålesund. Thank you for your consideration!</p>

                <h2>About Perestroika</h2>
                <p>Perestroika, translated as 'restructuring', is a project headed up by producer Duncan Silvey, which
                    has seen different members and collaborators joining him in the studio and for live shows since
                    2016. This project was born out of a stint of long term unemployment before returning to study at
                    Goldsmiths University in south London in 2018, where Duncan performed his first live shows with
                    Israeli based sonic artist, Guy Fleisher. Duncan moved to south Bristol in 2019 (where he had lived
                    previously) and continued to write. This has resulted in a 3 track EP which will be released in late
                    2023 and will be accompanied by live shows. Thematically you can expect a narration on what it is to
                    become a new father, joining a mental fitness movement and women being the often un-reported
                    strength for men in hard times.</p>

        <h2>How Perestroika would use the grant</h2>
        <p>I am currently at a stage where I can enter into a release campaign, as I have a new three track EP recorded,
            mastered and ready to be released in 2023. This EP has taken almost three years to complete due to becoming
            a new father in July 2021. The origins of the songs were improvised loops, created at Factory Studios across
            late 2020 - 2022, which were then taken home and song arrangements created around them.

            Perestroika is a project which serves me by providing a channel to express my thoughts through both poetry
            and music. These most recent songs have especially taken me a long time to create as I have undertaken the
            writing process, mixing and post-production processes mostly alone with input from some trusted friends
            around Bristol and south London.

            A Future Sound of Bristol prize will enable me to rehearse with a live band that I am currently putting
            together. The live shows will be a hybrid of human players (Drums, Bass, Guitar & Piano) interacting with
            Ableton Live to control pre-recorded stems and audio effects. This setup will require a high level of
            proficiency to execute and being able to rehearse within the fantastic facilities at Factory Studios will be
            a huge help to the quality of the musical output before playing public shows.

            The prize money (dependant on the amount awarded) will be utilised to create the following (ranked in
            priority order):

            - A music video for each of the three tracks on the new EP
            - A live music video of the band playing one of the tracks at Factory Studios
            - A limited run of vinyl pressings for the EP (50 max)
            - Artwork designed for each of the tracks
            - Artwork designed for the cover of the EP
            - A new artist logo design
            - New press shots by a professional photographer</p>

                <h2>About daju / Nu Bristol Sound</h2>
                <p>Joshua Sasanow AKA daju has always maintained a steady creative output of his own music. Whilst
                    principally a Pianist, String player and vocalist, Josh is a capable Guitarist (bass, electric and
                    acoustic), he plays the accordian and harmonica, and flatters himself that he can push at the very
                    least usefully coherent music out of most anything that it is possible to tune, and is an
                    enthusiastic collector of weird and wonderful percussion from all over the world. Lastly Josh has an
                    unmeasurable love of turntablism and while able to record basic stuff is in the Coop from human
                    traffic category of scratch djs, in that he will never equal how he sounds in his head but can still
                    crab pleasingly to the ear and is as good as he needs to be, along as he is armed with an editing
                    suite.
                    This broad ability (not just reeling it off for fun) has meant that he has almost from the absolute
                    beginning, produced music incorporating large instrument sections, as well as multiple vocalists and
                    wherever possible drums and electronic production and a live producer on the desk as well as
                    incorporating synths, hard and software and always and forever a scratch dj. He has formed and been
                    principle writer and front man for a few trip-hop and dubby hip hop acts. As Josh can play such a
                    variety of instruments himself, in order to translate his style of music into a live act with each
                    and every line in the original produced electronic piece, the bands he has brought together have at
                    times proved logistical challenges as they have stood at times as large as 15 and 16 piece bands.
                    Principally 'Horizontal Life' a 16 piece live trip hop band based in oxford and London, was from
                    where he enjpyed the most success and played gigs in all corners of the country, including Hackney
                    Empire, The Croft in Bristol, The O2 in Oxford and many places all over the UK, from Glasgow to
                    Plymouth and Edinburgh to London and everywhere in between.
                    Josh has performed as daju from the start at 14 years old MCing in his friends' bedrooms and never
                    changed for a single gig beyond occasionally irterchanging MC for D\J, although has been simply daju
                    for probably at least 15 years and can be heard and seen under the same pseudonym as a radio show
                    presenter, a comedy club or cabaret compere and also a performance poet.
                    Whilst trip hop and hip hop are his first loves, Josh loves dance music and where his events always
                    trod the super hard dance floors of gabba and breakcore (in fact a point of pride is that some of
                    the promotional artwork for the night Attack Of The..., a breakcore night he started in 2006 in
                    Oxford, are included in a worldwide published book documenting the unique art style that rose out of
                    the breakcore scene worldwide which is called 'PencilBreak'. As he has gotten older he has begun to
                    more often turn his hand to a bit of deep house and slow breaks. This has derived from another
                    signature of his work. That is that he religiously uses almost entirely sounds and samples recorded
                    himself and then sampled and resampled for even decades. It means that he has endless production
                    media to draw from and from the huge banks of instrument stems and unending folders of variations of
                    edits saved has never and will never had to worry about royalties to be paid or writers to be
                    credited as he owns close to every sound he uses. From this bountiful lexicon most recently has
                    begun to emerge a growing catalogue of intelligent deep and progressive house, techno and breaks,
                    born out of 25 years of off cuts and reedits that hint to the evolving styles of music in that time
                    and gives his music, if nothing else, an individual and unique aesthetic and one that is greatly
                    varied.
                    In a few words, he always endeavours to be original, progressive and thought provoking, whether
                    through his lyrics or music. Apart from when he's lounging in his head in 1995 pushing out his
                    beloved trip hop, a baton he's carried ever since and will fully never stop.</p>

        <h2>How daju / Nu Bristol Sound would use the grant</h2>
        <p>Daju, while being indicative of the creative output of josh sasanow, has also always implicitly included the
            creative talents of a fairly large pool of musicians and vocalists. Ever since the break up of Horizontal
            Life in 2008, daju has made it his business to showcase the considerable talents of those individuals he is
            lucky enough to be able to work with.
            As time has progressed what became apparent was that as much as featuring guest vocalists on his own music,
            each guest vocalist now has folders of tracks that equate to albums, eps or at the very least singles.
            Without intention, a ready made label of neo soul, triphop, lofi hip hop, dub and ecclectic dance music had
            emerged.
            For years daju was hesitant to move to bristol, his love of triphop making him feel like he must have a
            valid offering to present to the home of the sound before rocking up and making any noise. Josh has been
            running events for 25 years including HOdgepodge Festival and Productions, which has had residency at the
            croft, multiple halloweens at The Black Swan and various other events over the years in terms of presence in
            Bristol. Beyond that events have spanned the country, including the 3 day festivakl in Ofordshire from
            2010-2013 and clunbights from glasgow to londo to brighton to leeds, and have ties with labels ad artists
            all over the continent and beyond.
            So what we have in its infancy now is 'Nu Bristol Sound' a roster of vocalists and producers born from the
            move to the city and and the intention to present live events of an ecclectic style as well as standard
            clubnights that will be intrinsically rooted in the culture of Bristol. Based in Arnos Vale, which seems to
            be aptly exploding with the new, 2023 is earmarked to see the launch of the label and the associated events
            company as well as the first raft of releases from 'Nu Bristol Sound'. A tip of the cap to those without
            whom we would not exist but also a commitment to showcasing the best slow and sexy that the city has to
            offer.
            Any assistance we might get from sources such as this will help us to better launch our creative vision,
            ensure that we have found the cream of the bristol downtempo dairy and just do proud the progenitors of the
            genres we work with as well as the city that birthed them, and us.</p>

                    sound, receiving plaudits all over the world, notably from Spotify, Starbucks and BBC Introducing.
                    Combining upbeat instrumentation with sombre lyrics, the synthy, guitar-soaked quintet create a
                    juxtaposition in their music that allows for a deep connection with their dreamy pop-driven songs.

                    Originally born out of the solo bedroom project of Harry Leigh, the band is also made up of
                    singer/guitarist Kate Daggett, George Coggan on guitar, James Rowland on bass and drummer Tom
                    Andrews. Not scared to tackle hard-hitting topics such as mental health, relationships, and domestic
                    abuse; Harry writes from the heart, wanting to normalise difficult conversations and honesty.

                    Despite spending most of 2022 rebuilding, writing, and recording, Stay Lunar found themselves

                    Dot to Dot and 110 Above Festival. Now in 2023, a fresh new chapter beckons; with an evolved sound,

        <h2>How Stay Lunar would use the grant</h2>
        <p>Stay Lunar is a musical project that has been in the works since 2018. We are an ambitious and enthusiastic
            group that live and breathe music – hoping to turn it into career.

            We are currently self-managed, and aside from mixing/mastering, do everything ourselves – which so far has
            landed us lots of success: We’ve had support from BBC Introducing in the West on several occasions, with 2
            ‘track of the week’s, 500+ total airplays on Amazing Radio, several features in the Tom Robinson run ‘Fresh
            on the Net’ (Fresh Faves) and lots of editorial playlist love from Spotify, Deezer, YouTube Music and
            Deezer. Not only this, we’ve impressed the likes of actor Robert Carlyle and award-winning producer Jake
            Gosling (Ed Sheeran, etc.), who has added us to the Hotel Chocolat in-store playlist on multiple occasions.
            Our biggest win was being playlisted by Starbucks across the US, meaning plays in thousands of stores for
            many months. This allowed us to reach thousands of new listeners across the pond.

            We released our recent batch of singles via small indie label SAM Records, who help us out with a little bit
            of PR, but provide no financial help. Historically, we have used whatever money we had to record singles,
            releasing them sporadically and occasionally stringing a few together to create a makeshift EP. With the
            current financial climate, it is harder than ever to justify certain costs; a common conversation we have is
            'can we afford to lose money doing that gig', or 'will the studio fees be worth it', etc., and I think the
            pressure and weight that comes with money can really stifle the creative process.

            The impact The Future Sound of Bristol prize would have could be monumental for us; In the short term would
            be a huge mental boost, followed by the comfort to create with less pressure, knowing that we'll be able to
            follow through with a project we so dearly have our sights set on. In the longer term, having an album
            rather than resorting to churning out singles, we feel would be a huge step - The creative freedom that
            would come with an album, we believe, would really allow us to showcase the very best of our talents, and
            create something the world could connect with in a way we haven't been able to before. Not only this, having
            to focus less energy on covering costs for creating music, we’d be able to throw more of our effort and
            energy into our live performances, investing more in travelling further for gigs and reaching as many ears
            as possible. Also, having free sessions at Factory Studios would be a massive help for us to save some costs
            on rehearsals.

            There has never been a better time for us as a band to receive financial help - I think we're in a strong
            position as band where we have stability, huge motivation and creativity bursting at the seams. Having
            recently been likened to artists such as Bombay Bicycle Club, The War on Drugs, New Order and Two Door
            Cinema Club, we want to harness all this energy and creativity that we have, turning it into something as
            big as those comparisons. We genuinely feel that we are on the cusp of realising our potential as we attempt
            to show the world what we’ve got - The Future Sound of Bristol prize could be the catalyst for just that.

            Thank you for taking the time to read our many words! Please feel free to get in contact if there's anything
            else you need, or would like to know.

        <h2>How Nederveen would use the grant</h2>
        <p>Hello! So… last year I recorded a collection of songs. 10 acoustic videos and 8 fully produced tracks. This
            year, I'm making a 10-track covers project and a 5-track EP. This time I want to do a good job marketing. I
            want to run ads on everything, create a bunch of good-looking content, work with some marketing companies
            and anything else I can think of. Any investment received would go directly towards that, the cost of the
            recordings (which are frankly destroying me), and any branding material (photos, videos, merch etc). The
            project is transitioning to a more singer/songwriter sound, rather than the big band it was before. I want
            good, simple songs, with simple arrangements, telling stories and that's it. It was a 7-piece and it's now a
            3-piece. Thanks for your time.</p>

                <h2>About The Good Beast</h2>
                <p>The Good Beast is a six-piece whirlpool of crunching psychedelic rock that will blow your aura to
                    next Wednesday. They have worked in various formations for a decade and now come together as The
                    Good Beast.

                    Right now their debut album is undergoing a crowdfunding campaign to be pressed into vinyl. The
                    album is a celebration of years of collaboration and friendship. The songwriting is primarily down
                    to Bill Merrick, whilst the songs are sung by the truthful voice of Bea Piper. Louis Alberry and
                    Bill Merrick alternate in playing lead guitar. Jack Cullimore is on synth and percussion and has
                    also mixed the entire album. Ollie Grant plays kit and Alec Harrison on fretless bass. We have
                    worked collaboratively to come up with arrangements for all the songs, producing something that
                    feels special and very exciting.

                    The songs speak of a desire to seek the wilderness. They attempt to find truth and simplicity in a
                    world so lost in productivity and individuality. There is melancholia to some of the material, which
                    is heard in both the lyrics and the harmony. In other songs, pumping riffs and punchy rhythm drive
                    the songs into a playful and dream-like world. Often, one song may take you through both of these
                    landscapes, making the music intriguing and playful.</p>

        <h2>How The Good Beast would use the grant</h2>
        <p>To explain how Future Sound of Bristol prize will help us, I must first describe where we are at now. We are
            currently feeling the energetic burst that is coming as we have our debut album back and it is being pressed
            onto vinyl and we have a UK / Netherlands tour organised for September. The momentum of years of work is
            begging to bootleg itself, making our journey deeper and more novel.

            To get to this point we have been putting all our gig money back into the project. We all maintain our own
            jobs and whatever we get from the band is snowballing into momentum. We have financially exhausted
            ourselves, even putting alot of money into the project ourselves to get these recordings made professionally
            and to have a well made short documentary about us. This is all well and good, but we have so much more
            material, another album has already begun to be rehearsed to record in October and it would allow us to
            breathe so much if we could have help to get those recordings underway.

            Bea the lead singer and myself (the songwriter) have applied for funding but we are both dyslexic and didn't
            get approved. Not that being dyslexic should stop you from getting funding but we found that really hard and
            we often see musicians who haven't worked as nearly as much as we have getting all sorts funding because
            they are better at admin.

            As of recent, a psychedelic research society has asked us to headline the JamJar in June, people are saying
            Bea sings like Joni Mitchell, people are freaking out at our gigs, we continue to work on an endless supply
            of tunes and we are doing it right here in Bristol! Please future sound of Bristol please consider us!

            Matt Mysko who worked at Abbey Road studios for eight years, who now lives in Bristol, turned us on to you
            folks and I think a good omen so.

            I haven't been able to upload a track to this page, but please let me send you a track. We have finished our
            debut album and it sounds so lovely.

            Thanks for the opportunity,

            From Bill</p>

                <h2>About Heyouki</h2>
                <p>A Neo-Soul/Contemporary Jazz 9-piece, purveying sultry grooves and improvised camaraderie. Sonically,
                    Heyouki experiments with simple yet deep-in-feel Hip Hop rhythms, culminated with complex time
                    signatures and rudiments, layered with thick Jazz harmony.

                    Starting as a trio in 2019, the Bristol collective of Heyouki has grown into a full and rich group
                    of 9 friends and musical collaborators, playing shows and festivals across the UK.</p>

        <h2>How Heyouki would use the grant</h2>
        <p>Heyouki has been working hard as a independent passion project of many professional musicians in Bristol. Our
            debut mixtape and our upcoming singles have been multi-track recorded in pieces, members of the band having
            engineered the sessions, recorded, mixed ourselves, with only the mastering being done by a non band-member.

            While incredibly joyful and fun, this has been a big commitment of time, money and energy, contributing to a
            slower recording production cycle than some of our peers. The Future Sound of Bristol prize providing
            support, funding and rehearsal space will be invaluable in providing the band a joyful lift to continue
            working hard. We would use the funding to pay for professional level recording sessions with an experienced
            producer to finish off our debut EP in one fell swoop, and to support the releases with a strong marketing
            campaign/music videos to support the releases.

            I believe that the music we have released already is a testament to the potential and quality that Heyouki
            is building upon, and that we are capable of making the most of the support that Factory and Audiotarky can
            provide.</p>
